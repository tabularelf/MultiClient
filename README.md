# MultiClient v1.1.4

## NOTICE:
While I understand that this is a tool designed for testing networking on the same machine with ease, I don't actually provide networking support. You can join the [GameMaker Discord Server](https://discord.gg/gamemaker) instead and ask in the `#netcode` channel for networking consulting.
Only things that are specifically got to do with MultiClient (bugs or general enquires) can be addressed to me instead. 

A multi client extension for networking development for GameMaker 2022.6+

If you have any questions or issues, please submit an issue!

## How to Install

2. Once downloaded, head over to Tools -> Import Local Package in GameMaker.
3. Press "Add All" and press "Ok".

You can change how many clients boot up upon launch for Windows/GX.games (Opera GX)/HTML5<p>
By heading over to the extension itself and changing "Number_Of_Clients" to any value.
You can also check `Enable_Debug_Mode` (Experimental) if you need this to work in the debugger.<p>
